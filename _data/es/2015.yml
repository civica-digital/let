He graduated from Duke University with a degree in Chemistry. During college, he had a chance to conduct research at Yale and New York University, and also studied abroad at Oxford for one year. After college, he took a gap year to work in a research lab at Oakland Children’s Hospital and also worked in Vietnam on different projects the summer before medical school. In medical school, he was a student representative to the Association of American Medical Colleges, managed Stanford’s Arbor Free Clinic, and taught a variety of courses for undergraduate and graduate students. In the future, he hopes to become an orthopedic surgeon and work towards developing access to surgical care in developing areas. He is extremely excited to participate in the MECATE program for the chance to learn public entrepreneurship skills and to meet engaged students from around the world with a strong interest in making a difference.
